# United-Healthcare-Assassin
How did the UHC Assassin figure out where Brian Thompson was? This is the short writeup using some quick google searching:

1. Prior to the assassination, we know UHC stated: "UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) will host its annual Investor Conference for analysts and institutional investors in New York City on Wednesday, December 4, 2024, beginning at 8:00 a.m. EST."
2. On google maps & within NYC, there are numerous results regarding the term "United Health Group", however the relevant results are clearly those in the centre of NYC. 
3. Thus, the two possibilities would be: an online conference held within the UHC building (unlikely, this seemed to be an in person event), or an in person conference held at some hotel.
4. With the latter, we can narrow down the location to hotels near the UHC NYC buildings.
5. When asking chatgpt: "which hotels in new york are popular with investor conferences?", it cites 5 plausible hotels, with the Hilton Midtown being the first,
   followed by the Marriot Marquis, Grand Hyatt, Sheraton, Millenium Broadway :

7. According to AP: "Nov. 24 10:11 p.m. â€” The suspected shooter arrives in New York City on a Greyhound bus at the Port Authority terminal. The bus originated in Atlanta and made six or seven stops on the way to New York. Police could not immediately determine where he got on the bus. **The man then takes a taxi to the area of the New York Hilton Midtown and is there for about a half hour.**"

8. Given the Assassins background & long term relationship with UHC, he likely would have second or first hand knowledge of which conference locations were popular with the company.
9. As per CBS: "The Banner reports the Mangione family.... According to the Banner, **family businesses also include the Lorien Health Services nursing homes and radio station WCBM-AM**."

10. And per GBMC: "Delivering a baby at GBMC is an unspoken rule in the Mangione family..."

11. It is clear the Mangione Family has a long term stake in the healthcare business, and would likely know of the top conferences relevant to it.
12. Thus, with regards to the Hilton Midtown, google searching "which hotels are medical conferences held in new york" also reveals that it is one of the candidates,
with the most notable meeting representing it being the "CONGRESS of WORLD FEDERATION of INTERVENTIONAL and THERAPEUTIC NEURORADIOLOGY" (xraying your skull)

13. In conclusion, it would not be hard for Luigi to pull his family's long term experience & knowledge with the healthcare sector to determine where a large healthcare insurance company would be hosting its investor conference.
14. After determining the location, it could be possible for him to simply inquire Zack Sopcak or Eric Hausman as to whom might be speaking at this event.
